There are 10 cases and 1000 patient notes for each case in the annotated dataset. 

# 3. Distribution of Labels  

- Each case has a different number of features (clinical concept) that we try to predict if patient notes contain it.

- Distribution of classes regarding understanding the class distribution; can be displayed with **feature-distribution-case_n.png** charts.
